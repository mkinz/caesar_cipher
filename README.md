# caesar_cipher

This is an implementation of the caesar cipher script. Also included is a brute-force cipher breaker, which iterates through all 26 index shift encryptions and prints 26 possible phrases, and another (objectively worse) implementation of the cipher which uses a hash table rather than an array to map letters and their indices. 

future work:
-add intelligent filtering to the breaker function to distinguish english words/phrases from noise
